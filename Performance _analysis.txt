Performance Analysis – FIR Filter

Filter Type: Low Pass FIR Filter
Filter Order: 20
Sampling Frequency: 1000 Hz
Cutoff Frequency: 100 Hz

The FIR filter removes high-frequency noise from the input signal.
The filtered output is smoother than the input signal.
FIR filters are stable because they do not use feedback.

Conclusion:
The FIR filter performs efficiently and meets the task requirements.
